# Spotify Songs Analysis 2023
## ðŸ“‹ Project Description
This project performs an exploratory data analysis on Spotify's most streamed songs in 2023. 

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
- Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis of streaming patterns
- Visualization of musical characteristics
- Analysis of temporal trends
- Platform comparison (Spotify vs. Apple Music playlists)

## Libraries that were used
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Optional

```
#### Exploring the Data
- In the first part of this project is getting a dataset overview. So, I created a piece of code to help me check missing values and any abnormalities within the dataset.
- After running the code, I then discovered that there were a few missing values within the 'shazam' column and 'key' column
- This piece of code also returns basic descriptive statistics of the 'streams' column such as the mean, median (50th Percentile), and standard deviation.
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Read the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('spotify-2023.csv')

# Let's first look at problematic rows in the streams column
print("=== Problematic Values in Streams Column ===")
# Print rows where streams contains non-numeric characters (after removing commas)
problematic_streams = df[~df['streams'].str.replace(',', '').str.match(r'^\d+$')]
print("\nRows with non-numeric streams values:")
print(problematic_streams[['track_name', 'artist(s)_name', 'streams']])

# Now let's clean the streams column properly
def clean_streams(value):
    try:
        # Remove commas and convert to numeric
        return pd.to_numeric(str(value).replace(',', ''))
    except:
        # If conversion fails, return NaN
        return np.nan

# Clean the streams column
df['streams'] = df['streams'].apply(clean_streams)

# Print basic info about the cleaned dataset
print("\n=== Dataset Info After Cleaning ===")
print(df.info())

print("\n=== Missing Values ===")
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print(missing_values[missing_values > 0])

print("\n=== Streams Statistics ===")
print(df['streams'].describe())

# Show top 5 most streamed songs
print("\n=== Top 5 Most Streamed Songs ===")
top_5_streams = df.nlargest(5, 'streams')[['track_name', 'artist(s)_name', 'streams']]
print(top_5_streams)
```

## Overview of the Dataset
- There are 953 rows and 24 columns
- Below are the data types of each column
- The missing values are were also indicated which can be read for the streams column, there is a 1 missing entry or rather an abnormal entry and for the shazam_charts column there are 50 missing values.

- This is the piece of code that produced these outputs
```
# Print basic info about the cleaned dataset
print("\n=== Dataset Info After Cleaning ===")
print(df.info())

print("\n=== Missing Values ===")
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print(missing_values[missing_values > 0])

```
## Basic Descriptive Statistics
- The mean, median, and standard deviation of the streams column are as follows
> Mean - 5.141374
> 
> Median - 2.905309
> 
> Standard Deviation - 5.668569

- Distribution of released_year
> The majority of the songs are from the recent years

> Notable outliers are songs that were in the 1930s - 1960s

> The distribution shows that Spotifyâ€™s most streamed songs are predominantly modern

- Distribution of artist_count
> Most songs have a solo or duet

> Notable outliers are songs that have a high number of collaborating artists (up to 8 artists)

> Collaborations with 3 artists are rare.

- This is the piece of code that showed these graphs
```
# Set up the plotting style
plt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-bright')
fig, ((ax1, ax2), (ax3, ax4)) = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(15, 12))

# Distribution of released_year
sns.histplot(data=df, x='released_year', bins=30, ax=ax1)
ax1.set_title('Distribution of Release Years')
ax1.set_xlabel('Release Year')
ax1.set_ylabel('Number of Songs')

# Add vertical line for median year
median_year = df['released_year'].median()
ax1.axvline(x=median_year, color='red', linestyle='--', label=f'Median Year: {median_year:.0f}')
ax1.legend()

#Box plot for released_year to show outliers
sns.boxplot(data=df, y='released_year', ax=ax2)
ax2.set_title('Box Plot of Release Years')
ax2.set_ylabel('Release Year')

# Distribution of artist_count
sns.histplot(data=df, x='artist_count', bins=range(1, df['artist_count'].max() + 2), ax=ax3)
ax3.set_title('Distribution of Artist Count')
ax3.set_xlabel('Number of Artists')
ax3.set_ylabel('Number of Songs')

# Box plot for artist_count to show outliers
sns.boxplot(data=df, y='artist_count', ax=ax4)
ax4.set_title('Box Plot of Artist Count')
ax4.set_ylabel('Number of Artists')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Top Performers
- This snapshot shows the top 5 most streamed tracks

- This is the top 5 most frequent artists based on the number of tracks in the dataset
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b93b4495-190f-486e-8104-32370ff1ab2e)

- This is the piece of code that produced these outputs
```
# Show top 5 most streamed songs
print("\n=== Top 5 Most Streamed Songs ===")
top_5_streams = df.nlargest(5, 'streams')[['track_name', 'artist(s)_name', 'streams']]
print(top_5_streams)
```
```
# Count the occurrences of each artist and get the top 5
top_artists_by_tracks = data['artist(s)_name'].value_counts().head(5)

# Display the result
print("Top 5 Artists by Track Count:")
print(top_artists_by_tracks)
```

## Temporal Trends
- There's a dramatic increase in the number of tracks released in recent years
- The peak appears to be around 2023 with approximately 400 tracks
- Prior to 2010, there were very few tracks in the dataset
- There's an exponential growth pattern from roughly 2015 onwards

- There's significant variation in releases across months
- Peak releases occur in Month 1 (January) and Month 5 (May), both with around 130-140 tracks
- The lowest number of releases appears to be in Month 8 (August) with about 45 tracks
- There seems to be a cyclical pattern with higher releases in the beginning and middle of the year
