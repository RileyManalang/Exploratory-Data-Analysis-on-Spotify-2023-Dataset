# Spotify Songs Analysis 2023
## ðŸ“‹ Project Description
This is an exploratory data analysis project on Spotify's most streamed songs in 2023. 

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
- Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis of streaming patterns
- Visualization of musical characteristics
- Analysis of temporal trends
- Platform comparison

## Libraries that were used
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Optional

```
#### Exploring the Data
- In the first part of this project is getting a dataset overview. So, I created a piece of code to help me check missing values and any abnormalities within the dataset.
- Then I tried to clean the dataset of its abnormalities
- Below is the piece of code that I used
```
# Read the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('spotify-2023.csv')

# Let's first look at problematic rows in the streams column
print("=== Problematic Values in Streams Column ===")
# Print rows where streams contains non-numeric characters (after removing commas)
problematic_streams = df[~df['streams'].str.replace(',', '').str.match(r'^\d+$')]
print("\nRows with non-numeric streams values:")
print(problematic_streams[['track_name', 'artist(s)_name', 'streams']])

# Now let's clean the streams column properly
def clean_streams(value):
    try:
        # Remove commas and convert to numeric
        return pd.to_numeric(str(value).replace(',', ''))
    except:
        # If conversion fails, return NaN
        return np.nan

# Clean the streams column
df['streams'] = df['streams'].apply(clean_streams)

# Print basic info about the cleaned dataset
print("\n=== Dataset Info After Cleaning ===")
print(df.info())

```

## Overview of the Dataset
- There are 953 rows and 24 columns
- Below are the data types of each column
- The missing values were also indicated, which can be read for the streams column; there is one missing entry or rather an abnormal entry, and for the shazam_charts column, there are 50 missing values.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/334f5fec-1388-4f7a-929c-1e1673247558)

- This is the piece of code that produced these outputs
```
# Print basic info about the cleaned dataset
print("\n=== Dataset Info After Cleaning ===")
print(df.info())

print("\n=== Missing Values ===")
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print(missing_values[missing_values > 0])

```
## Basic Descriptive Statistics
- The mean, median, and standard deviation of the streams column are as follows
    - Mean - 5.141374
    - Median - 2.905309
    - Standard Deviation - 5.668569

- Distribution of released_year
    - The majority of the songs are from the recent years
    - Notable outliers are songs that were in the 1930s - 1960s
    - The distribution shows that Spotifyâ€™s most streamed songs are predominantly modern

- Distribution of artist_count
    - Most songs have a solo or duet
    - Notable outliers are songs that have a high number of collaborating artists (up to 8 artists)
    - Collaborations with three artists are rare.

```
# Set up the plotting style
plt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-bright')
fig, ((ax1, ax2), (ax3, ax4)) = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(15, 12))

# Distribution of released_year
sns.histplot(data=df, x='released_year', bins=30, ax=ax1)
ax1.set_title('Distribution of Release Years')
ax1.set_xlabel('Release Year')
ax1.set_ylabel('Number of Songs')

# Add vertical line for median year
median_year = df['released_year'].median()
ax1.axvline(x=median_year, color='red', linestyle='--', label=f'Median Year: {median_year:.0f}')
ax1.legend()

#Box plot for released_year to show outliers
sns.boxplot(data=df, y='released_year', ax=ax2)
ax2.set_title('Box Plot of Release Years')
ax2.set_ylabel('Release Year')

# Distribution of artist_count
sns.histplot(data=df, x='artist_count', bins=range(1, df['artist_count'].max() + 2), ax=ax3)
ax3.set_title('Distribution of Artist Count')
ax3.set_xlabel('Number of Artists')

# Box plot for artist_count to show outliers
sns.boxplot(data=df, y='artist_count', ax=ax4)
ax4.set_title('Box Plot of Artist Count')

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b93b4495-190f-486e-8104-32370ff1ab2e)

- This is the piece of code that produced these outputs
```
# Show top 5 most streamed songs
print("\n=== Top 5 Most Streamed Songs ===")
top_5_streams = df.nlargest(5, 'streams')[['track_name', 'artist(s)_name', 'streams']]
print(top_5_streams)
```
```
# Count the occurrences of each artist and get the top 5
top_artists_by_tracks = data['artist(s)_name'].value_counts().head(5)

# Display the result
print("Top 5 Artists by Track Count:")
print(top_artists_by_tracks)
```

## Temporal Trends
- There's a dramatic increase in the number of tracks released in recent years
- The peak appears to be around 2023 with approximately 400 tracks
- Prior to 2010, there were very few tracks in the dataset
- There's an exponential growth pattern from roughly 2015 onwards

- There's significant variation in releases across months
- Peak releases occur in Month 1 (January) and Month 5 (May), both with around 130-140 tracks
- The lowest number of releases appears to be in Month 8 (August) with about 45 tracks
- There seems to be a cyclical pattern with higher releases in the beginning and middle of the year

## Genere and Music Characteristics
- Overall Correlation Pattern:
    - All attributes show relatively weak negative correlations with streams (all bars point downward)
    - The correlations range from nearly 0 to approximately -0.11

- Strongest Correlations
    - Speechiness_% has the strongest negative correlation (around -0.11)
    - Danceability_% has the second strongest negative correlation (around -0.10)
    - The remaining attributes (liveness_%, instrumentalness_%, valence_%, energy_%, acousticness_%, and bpm) have weaker negative correlations

- Scatter Plot Analysis:
    - None show a strong linear relationship with streams
    - All display considerable scatter/dispersion
    - The highest streaming numbers appear across various values of these attributes, suggesting no single "optimal" value

- Correlation between danceability_% & energy_% and valence_% and acousticness_%
    - Danceability and Energy show a weak positive correlation (0.2)
    - Valence and acousticness show a weak negative correlation (-0.082)

```
## Platform Popularity
- Platform Reach (means):
    - Spotify Playlists: 5,200 tracks
    - Spotify charts: 12 tracks
    - Apple playlists: 68 tracks
- Based on this data, Spotify playlists appear to include a much broader range of tracks and have significantly higher numbers overall. However, looking at the charts (which typically represent current popularity), Spotify seems more selective with only about 12 tracks on average compared to Apple's playlist inclusion of about 68 tracks.
